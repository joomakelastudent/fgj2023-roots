Concept

### Target

We aim for a simplistic hack and slash -type action game with fast-paced and
unforgiving, but rewarding and fun combat. Explore dungeons and send enemies
to meet their maker, before they send you to meet yours.

### Connection to GGJ's theme

With the year's theme defined as "ROOTS", our project returns to the roots
of game development in its technical execution. No fancy graphics, no premade
engines and no complex ideas. All graphics are done with ASCII-characters and
the game is outputted directly to a terminal, no modern desktop environments
needed.
