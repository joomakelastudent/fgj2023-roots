=============

Game project of team Ryhmä Rämä for the Finnish Game Jam of 2023-02-03.

Concept
-------

You are in the woods and snakes are out to get you. Dodge them and survive.

### Connection to GGJ's theme

With the year's theme defined as "ROOTS", our project returns to the roots
of game development in its technical execution. No fancy graphics, no premade
engines and no complex ideas. All graphics are done with ASCII-characters and
the game is outputted directly to a terminal, no modern desktop environments
needed.
