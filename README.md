### Target

We aim for a simplistic hack and slash -type character-action game with
fast-paced, unforgiving and satisfying combat. Enemies fold like cartboard,
but so does the hero. With everybody throwing around lethal moves, dashing,
dodging and ruthlessness are the name of the game. Isolate and vanquish your
enemies before they surround and overwhelm you.

### Connection to GGJ's theme

With the year's theme defined as "ROOTS", our project returns to the roots
of game development in its technical execution. No fancy graphics, no premade
engines and no complex ideas. All graphics are done with ASCII-characters and
the game is outputted directly to a terminal, no modern desktop environments
needed.
